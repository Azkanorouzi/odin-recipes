                  <h4>MARINATE</h4>
                  <p> MARINATE: add the saffron to a small bowl along with 1 tablespoon of hot water and let it steep,
                    covered
                    for 5-7 minutes or until the water turns a bright yellow (if using). In a large bowl, combine the
                    saffron
                    water and all the marinade ingredients except the chicken. Add the chicken and stir to coat evenly.
                    At
                    this
                    point, you can pop everything into a zip-top bag (for marinating) or just leave in the same bowl.
                    Add
                    the
                    chicken and toss to combine. Cover the bowl or zip the bag and allow the chicken to marinate for at
                    least 6
                    hours or up to 24 hours in the refrigerator. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h4>PREP</h4>
                  <p> Remove the chicken from the refrigerator about 1 hour before cooking. Add the cubed veggies to the
                    chicken, toss to combine and let marinate. Thread the chicken on to the skewers alternating with the
                    red
                    onions, green and red bell peppers. Repeat until you've used up all the chicken and veggies and
                    discard
                    any
                    leftover marinade. When ready to grill, prepare the grill by lightly oiling the grates with any high
                    heat
                    oil or just spray with cooking spray and let it preheat on medium-high.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h4>GRILL</h4>
                  <p>Grill the kebabs until they cook all the way through. You can test to see if the chicken is done by
                    slicing
                    through a piece with a knife, it should take roughly 8-12 minutes total. Serve warm over buttered
                    saffron
                    rice, vermicelli rice, or with flatbread and a salad.</p>
                </li>
              </ol>
              <h4>Notes</h4>
              <p>
                If you're using wooden skewers instead of the metal kind, I suggest soaking them in water for at least 6
                hours before using them (you can also just soak them overnight if you're marinating the chicken a day in
                advance.)
                Though the chicken will be ready to use in 6 hours, I highly recommend marinating the chicken a day in
                advance, the flavors are so so so much more intense that way!
